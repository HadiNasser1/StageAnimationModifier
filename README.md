A quick script to make animations of stage assets (usually characters) viewable in Blender. There's also another script that converts the keyframes back to the compatible stage format.

To use, simply change input_file_path and output_file_path to match the path of the animation you want to convert. Be sure to include doubble backslashes when inputting the file path like so: stg\\106\\Dardevil.yml"

LoopFrame may have to be adjusted manually in the yml if the animation is meant to loop.
